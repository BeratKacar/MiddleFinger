# MiddleFinger
Just my computer hates middle fingers
This Python project uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect hand gestures in real-time through a webcam. It captures frames from the camera, processes them with MediaPipe's hand detection model, and checks if the middle finger is the only finger raised while the others are down. When this specific gesture is detected, a message is displayed on the screen and the program waits for 2 seconds before executing a system shutdown command. If the gesture is not detected, it displays a message indicating the hand is being tracked. The project includes features like flipping the camera feed horizontally, displaying landmarks for hand joints, and the ability to shut down the computer if the middle finger gesture is recognized. Additionally, the code includes a comment that can be toggled to prevent the computer shutdown.
